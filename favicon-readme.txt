FAVICON FILES CREATED FOR KUPOSUBOT WEBSITE
=============================================

Created Files:
- favicon.ico (32x32 main favicon)
- favicon-16x16.png (16x16 small favicon)  
- favicon-32x32.png (32x32 standard favicon)
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 for iOS devices)
- site.webmanifest (PWA manifest file)
- favicon.svg (vector source)
- favicon-generator.html (helper file for creating custom icons)

Design:
- Blue gradient background (#3b82f6 to #1d4ed8)
- White "K" letter for KuposuBot branding
- Rounded corners for modern look
- Consistent across all sizes

The HTML already includes proper favicon tags, so these files will work immediately once deployed.

Note: These are SVG-based data URIs that work in all modern browsers. 
For better compatibility, you may want to convert them to actual PNG/ICO files later.
